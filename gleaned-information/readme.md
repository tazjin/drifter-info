Gleaned Information
===================

Gleaned Information is an item that drops under certain circumstances when a
character is killed by Drifters or Circadian Seekers.

The Gleaned Information is visible in killmails (check for example [this one][])
and based on the ItemIDs I fetched the ones that didn't drop during our tests
today. The range is `34874` to `34883`.
