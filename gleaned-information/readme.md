Gleaned Information
===================

Gleaned Information shows up in the inventory at the end of every Entosis cycle
on a Jove Observatory.

The Gleaned Information is visible in killmails (check for example [this one][])
and based on the ItemIDs I fetched the ones that didn't drop during our tests
today. The range is `34874` to `34883`.
